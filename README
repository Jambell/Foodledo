usage
-----

If you have Perl installed, change directory to the foodledo-cli-?.?.? directory and type:

	perl foodledo.pl

You will enter and interactive mode where you can either select recipes for the shopping list (together with stuff like loo roll) or add new recipes to those stored.

If you want to call the script with command line arguments, you have the following options:

	--file <FILENAME>	--email <ADDRESS>	--sendmail <PATH_TO_SENDMAIL>	--select <QUOTED_LIST_OF_NUMERIC_VALUES>	--add ">title\ningredient 1 x\ningredients 2 x

using either the --select or --add flags will bypass the interactive mode.
